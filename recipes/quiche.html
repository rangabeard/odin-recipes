<h2>How to Make Quiche</h2>
<p>When it comes to quiche, we side with our own Chef John: "A proper quiche should be rich, custardy, and luxurious — not some kind of dense, baked omelet." Read on to get his tips for how to make a quiche.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
<li>chopped bacon</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>f you're adding onions, leeks, or other chopped veggies, give them a quick sauté first.</li>
<li>Prep your deep-dish pie pan (or tart pan) with pie dough for a single crust. We're going to "blind bake" the quiche crust before pouring in the filling.</li>
</ol>
